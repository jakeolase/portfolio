## About the project
Although inspired by portfolios of top ui/ux developers, this portfolio is designed from scratch. Bootstraps and other CSS Frameworks were not used in the process.

This website is prototyped using Figma. [View Figma File here.](https://www.figma.com/proto/Fz0IKKD4hwU0ezrvJjgkQd/Prototype-Design-%7C-%3Cjake%3E-of-all-trades?type=design&node-id=3-228&t=oWGvGpwGDQ8PfVQZ-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&mode=design)

## Features
This portfolio features a one-page website with five sections, namely
    - Hero Section
    - Skillset
    - Technologies
    - Projects
    - Contact

The website is designed this way in order to present the information directly to the viewers with less interactions required. 

Simplicity and Conciseness is the goal of the project, with emphasis on projects developed.
